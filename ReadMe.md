This Program is the first problem to the Euler Project.

The point is to find the multiples of 3 and 5 from all natural numbers ranging 
from 1 - 1000.

This program takes the range from 1 - 1000 and spreads the values that are multiples of 3 and 5 in an array.

INSTALATION OF PROGRAM 
To run the program you must clone the repository to your computer then...
open the repositories directory inside the terminal
Then run:

chmod +x MultipMultipulesof.py

(chmod +x changes permissions to allow the file to be made an executable)

after the file is an executable you can run the file just by writing...

./Multipulesof.py

inside the terminal shell.

This will give you the answer of the problem!
You can change the vlaue at which you want to find the multiples of 3 and 5 by 
changing the values from 1 - 1000 to any number you want!

Have fun!
